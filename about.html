            <p>
                As mentioned in the homepage, I started programming
                at 10 years old. However, I haven’t been consistent with
                it because I often get interested in so many things at once. <br/><br/>
                I used to be a workaholic and would work on a lot of personal projects
                when I was younger. Right when school was done, I remember that I would
                immediately work on projects I've set up for myself. <br/><br/>
                Nowadays, I’ve calmed down. I still like getting things done and I usually
                create tools or plugins to help me with that.

            <h1 class="section-header">Career Goals</h1>
            <p>
                I don’t have any grandiose goals just as my father wished for when he got me into programming, and I doubt that my work will turn me into a millionaire.<br/><br/>
                I however, like making tools or plugins that I will use in my day to day life. I often find very specific things that I need since there aren’t any other software or plugins that does what I specifically need. <br/><br/>
                Back when I was young, I often programmed for fun. I often made games but it never had a practical use in my life for it.<br/><br/>
                It was only within this year that I've gotten to use my programming skills for something practical and useful in my life, and I enjoy using things I've made, especially if it’s useful.

                    <h1>Steel Ball Run</h1>
                    I’m not a huge fan of action or hype scenes, and prefer slower paced media. However, Steel Ball Run was honestly the most fun I’ve ever had when reading. It was fun from beginning to end and I don’t remember a moment where I was bored.

                    <h1>Berserk</h1>
                    Berserk made me think deeply about a lot of things. There were scenes that greatly impacted me to this day, such as Sparks of a Sword tip, Bonfire of Dreams, and Wounds. It made me realize that the little things are what makes life worth it.

                    <h1>Monster</h1>
                    This was really boring at first, but it became really interesting after episode 25. For me, I didn’t really get the point until I started reading on some analyses, so when I started to understand it, that’s when it became my favorite.
