                As mentioned in the homepage, I started programming
                at 10 years old. However, I haven’t been consistent with
                it because I often get interested in so many things at once. <br/><br/>
                I used to be a workaholic and would work on a lot of personal projects
                when I was younger. Right when school was done, I remember that I would
                immediately work on projects I've set up for myself. <br/><br/>
                Nowadays, I’ve calmed down. I still like getting things done and I usually
                create tools or plugins to help me with that.
