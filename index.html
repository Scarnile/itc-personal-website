            <p>Hello! You can call me Scarnile! 
                I initially started programming at 10 years old as a
                result of my dad telling me about Mark Zuckerberg
                and his success in making Facebook which
                inspired me to be a Computer Programmer when I grow up.

                    My biggest inspiration in programming comes from a comic called Berserk.</br></br>

                    I often worked really hard because I wanted to prove something. Usually I’d forget about everything else but the project I needed to get done.</br></br>

                    Reading berserk changed my perspective in a lot of things. I used to relate to the Main Antagonist because everything else is irrelevant except for his goals. We were both goal driven.</br></br>

                    As I grow older, I started relating to the Main Protagonist Instead. He doesn’t live as grand as Griffith, the main antagonist. He instead enjoys the little things in life, such as the sparks when swords clash in battle.</br></br>

                    In programming, I would usually look at the bigger picture of the project but Berserk taught me to enjoy the little things, such to enjoy every line of code that I write.
